a) Indirect Proof:
Suppose n is an integer such that 3n -h 2 is even, but n is not even. This means that n is odd.
If n is odd, it can be expressed as n 2k -h I for some integer k.
Now, let's substitute this expression for n into 3n + 2:
3n+2= 3(2k + 1) +2 = 6k +3+2 = 6k +5
Since 6k + 5 is odd (it is not divisible by 2), it contradicts the assumption that 3n + 2 is even.
Therefore, our initial assumption that n is odd must be false. Thus, n must be even.

b) Proof by Contradiction:
Suppose n is an integer such that 3n -F 2 is even, but n is not even. This means that n is odd.
If n is odd, it can be expressed as n 2k + 1 for some integer k.
Now, let's substitute this expression for n into 3n -F 2:
3n+2= 3(2k + 1) +2 6k +5
This implies that 3n + 2 is not even, as 6k + 5 is odd, contradicting our initial assumption.
Therefore, our initial assumption that n is odd must be false. Thus, n must be even.
In both cases, we have proved that if 3n + 2 is even, then n must be even.


Section 1.5 24

Let's prove that the product of two odd numbers is odd using direct proof:
Let's assume a and b are odd numbers, which means they can be expressed asa 2k + 1 and
b 2m -F 1, where k and m are integers.
Now, let's find the product of a and b:
ax (2k + 1) x (2m + 1)
Expanding this expression, we get:
a x b 4km + 2k + 2m + 1
Notice that each term in this expression is divisible by 2 except the constant term 1. This implies
that the product a >< b leaves a remainder ofl when divided by 2.
Since the result of the product a >< b leaves a remainder ofl when divided by 2, it is not divisible
by 2, which means it is odd.
Therefore, the product of two odd numbers a and b is odd.
